This plugin restrict the taxonomies terms that users can view, add, and edit in the admin panel.

== Description ==

Based on the Restrict Categories plugin, this plugin allows you to restrict the taxonomies terms that users or roles can use when they publish content. It also provide front end restriction for non logged users.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the restrict-taxonomies folder to to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin in Settings > Restrict Taxonomies
1. Choose the taxonomies *AND* the corresponding post types
1. Activate (or don't, as you wish) the front end rescrictions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*Does this plugin also works for page taxonomies ?*
Yes, the page post type will always be handled, therefore, it doesn't appear in the post types and taxonomies settings

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings are located in Settings > Restrict Taxonomies
2. First choose the post types and the taxonomies to handle
3. Select the categories allowed for a role or a user (note that user options override role options)
4. Should the plugin restrict taxonomies in the front end ?

== ToDo List ==
1. Prevent the user from accessing the single view of a CPT that is in a disallowed taxonomy
