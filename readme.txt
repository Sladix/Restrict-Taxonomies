This plugin restrict the taxonomies terms that users can view, add, and edit in the admin panel.

== Description ==

Based on the Restrict Categories plugin, this plugin allows you to restrict the taxonomies terms that users or roles can use when they publish content.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the restrict-taxonomies folder to to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin in Settings > Restrict Taxonomies
1. Choose the taxonomies *AND* the corresponding post types

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*Does this plugin also works for page taxonomies ?*
Yes, the page post type will always be handled, therefore, it doesn't appear in the post types and taxonomies settings

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings are located in Settings > Restrict Taxonomies
2. First choose the post types and the taxonomies to handle
3. Select the categories allowed for a role or a user (note that user options override role options)
4. Should the plugin restrict taxonomies in the front end ?
